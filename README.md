# Mini Project Using Object-Oriented Programming in Python

# Overview
This project is a veterinary management system implemented in Python, utilizing object-oriented programming principles. It includes classes to manage various aspects of a veterinary clinic, such as animals, their owners, and the clinic's operations.
The Animal class is an abstract base class that defines a common interface for all animals, with specific behaviors implemented in the subclasses Cat and Dog. The Owner class represents an animal's owner, encapsulating details like name and contact information, and includes methods for interacting with the clinic. The VeterinaryClinic class manages the clinic's operations, including consulting animals, calculating bills, and restocking medicines.

# Conclusions
This project effectively demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming in Python, providing a structured approach to managing the operations of a veterinary clinic. The emphasis on encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction results in organized and modular code. This structure makes the system easy to extend with additional features or adapt to different types of veterinary practices. Overall, the project serves as a solid foundation for building a more comprehensive veterinary management system.
